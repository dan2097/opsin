<!-- tagname == the name of the XML element that tokens in this file will be translated to
type == the type attribute on the XML element (for example indicates that a group is an aminoAcid)
subType == the subType attribute on the XML element (gives additional information about what exactly the tokens represent)
symbol == the one-letter code for the token, used by the grammar in regexes.xml 
ignoreWhenWritingXML == Tells the parser not to form an XML element out of these tokens. That means that these token are only syntactic and contain no useful information and are not useful after parsing has completed-->

<!--
  (the #PCDATA inside the tag) = the string to match
  value == Meaning depends on the name of the element e.g. SMILES for group, value of multipler for multiplier etc.

  acceptsAdditiveBonds == yes or abscent. If present indicates that subsituents (single radicals) will form additive bonds to this group when it has no hydrogen
  addBond == list of the following format: order of bond space ("id"|"locant"|"defaultId"|"defaultLocant") space (id|locant). If multiple bonds are to be added seperate by semicolons e.g. "2 defaultLocant 1;3 defaultLocant 3". Use "locant" if name is unambiguous even when locants are not provided. MUST be used in conjunction with the frontLocantsExpected attribute
  addGroup == list of the following format: SMILESofGroupToBeAdded space ("id"|"locant"|"defaultId"|"defaultLocant") space (id|locant) [space locantLabel]. If multiple groups are to be added seperate by semicolons e.g. "=O defaultLocant 9;=O defaultLocant 10" to add two double bonded oxygens, one by default at locant 9 and the other by default at locant 10. Use "locant" if name is unambiguous even when locants are not provided. MUST be used in conjunction with the frontLocantsExpected attribute
  addHeteroAtom == list of the following format: element of atom space ("id"|"locant"|"defaultId"|"defaultLocant") space (id|locant). If multiple heteroatoms are to be added seperate by semicolons e.g. "N defaultLocant 1;S defaultLocant 3". Use "locant" if name is unambiguous even when locants are not provided. MUST be used in conjunction with the frontLocantsExpected attribute
  additionalValue == Another value that the token takes. Currently only used for suffixes that mean the addition of two discrete suffixes
  alphaBetaClockWiseAtomOrdering == Listed in a clockwiese order, the locants of the atoms that define a pseudo 2D plane for alpha/beta stereochemistry.
  commonOxidationStatesAndMax == For elements, the typical oxidation states (comma seperated) then a colon and the maximum oxidation station. e.g. for iron "2,3:6" as 2 and 3 are typical. 6 is possible but atypical.
  defaultInID == As above but using the id of the atom instead. IDs are relative to this particular fragment
  defaultInLocant == The locant of the atom which by default an incoming fragment should connect to. Typically used on groups
  frontLocantsExpected == comma seperated list of locants indicating what locants are expected in front of this group. If one of these locants are found it will preferentially be assigned to the suffix of the group. The group should correspond to a retained name. (codified in P-29.6 of IUPAC 2004 rules)
  functionalIDs == Comma seperated ids of locations which are functionalIDs on a group. IDs are relative to this particular fragment. Functional IDs are used in ester formation.
  fusedRingNumbering ==same as above but for some rings with non standard numbering. This numbering is used to decide which sides correspond to the letters employed in fusing rings. It is neccesary where non standard numbering does not precess regularly around the edge of the fused ring system c.f. purine
  iminoLike == yes or abscent. If present indicates that the substituent can either be -X- or X= or even -X=. It changes some behaviour to ecnourage substitutive bonding rather than additive bonds where this substituent is involved. This attribute is mostly ignored when doing polymers for which imino is always -N-
  labels == What the locants are for this group. See the SMILESFragmentBuilder class
  locant == used for an/ane to prevent a locant being given
  naturalEntIsOpposite == Boolean to indicate that this trivial name has the opposite D/L stereochemistry to others in its class i.e. L- for carbohydrates or D- for amino acids
  outIDs == Comma separated ids of locations of radicals on a substituent. Typically used on substituents to create multivalent substituents. IDs are relative to this particular fragment
  suffixAppliesTo == comma seperated ids indicating where the suffix following a group should be applied. Currently used to direct the formation of trivial di-acids. IDs are relative to this particular fragment
  suffixAppliesToByDefault == same as suffixAppliesTo but can be overriden by given locants
  usableAsAJoiner == "no" or missing. If no then make sure not to use it as such when assigning implicit brackets
