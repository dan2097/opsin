<!--
  (the #PCDATA inside the tag) = the string to match
  value == depends on valType, or see the file itself
   valType = chain => aliphatic chain of $VALUE carbons
   valType = ring => aliphatic chain of $VALUE carbons
   valType = unsatring => conjugated chain of $VALUE carbons
   valType = partunsatring => aliphatic chain of $VALUE carbons which will later have at least one bond unsaturated
   valType = atom => single atom of the given symbol
   valType = dbkey => a key to fragments.xml
   valType = SMILES => see the SMILESFragmentBuilder class
  labels == What the locants are for this group. See the SMILESFragmentBuilder class
  fusedRingNumbering ==same as above but for some rings with non standard numbering. This numbering is used to decide which sides correspond to the letters employed in fusing rings. It is neccesary where non standard numbering does not precess regularly around the edge of the fused ring system c.f. purine
  defaultInLocant == The locant of the atom which by default an incoming fragment should connect to. Typically used on groups
  defaultInID == As above but using the id of the atom instead. IDs are relative to this particular fragment
  outID == An id that is designed as being an outID. This ID is relative to this particular fragment. If you want just one outID use this, not outIDs
  outIDs == Comma seperated ids of locations of radicals on a substituent. ? after id if this id is never used when the substituent is substituted onto. Typically used on substituents. IDs are relative to this particular fragment
  functionalIDs == Comma seperated ids of locations which are functionalIDs on a group. IDs are relative to this particular fragment. Functional IDs are used in ester formation.
  addGroup == list of the following format SMILESofGroupToBeAdded then a space then the word id or locant, then an id or locant as appropriate. If multiple groups are to be added seperate by semicolons e.g. "=O locant9;=O locant10" to add two double bonded oxygens, one by default at locant 9 and the other by default at locant 10
  addHeteroAtom == list of the following format element of atm then a space then the word id or locant, then an id or locant as appropriate. If multiple heteroatoms are to be added seperate by semicolons e.g. "N locant1;S locant3"
  addBond == list of the following format order of bond then a space then the word id or locant, then an id or locant as appropriate. If multiple bonds are to be added seperate by semicolons e.g. "2 locant1;3 locant3"
  usableAsAJoiner == "no" or missing. If no then make sure not to use it as such when assigning implicit brackets
  frontLocantsExpected == comma seperated list of locants indicating what locants are expected in front of this group. If one of these locants are found it will preferentially be assigned to the suffix of the group. The group should correspond to a retained name. (codified in P-29.6 of IUPAC 2004 rules)
  suffixAppliesTo == comma seperated ids indicating where the suffix following a group should be applied. Currently used to direct the formation of trivial di-acids. IDs are relative to this particular fragment
  additionalValue == Another value that the token takes. Currently only used for suffixes that mean the addition of two discrete suffixes
  locant == used for an/ane to prevent a locant being given
