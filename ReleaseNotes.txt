Version 0.6.0
OPSIN is now a mavenised project consisting of two modules: core and inchi. Core does name -->CML, inchi depends on core and allows conversion to inchi

Fused rings with any number of rings in a chain or formed entirely of 6 membered rings can now be numbered
Added support for E/Z/R/S where locants are given. Unlocanted cases will be dealt with in a subsequent release. In very large molecules a lack of memory may be encountered, this will be resolved in a subsequent release
