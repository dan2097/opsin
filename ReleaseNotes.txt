Version 0.60
OPSIN is now a mavenised project consisting of two modules: core and inchi. Core does name -->CML, inchi depends on core and allows conversion to inchi
Instead of CML an OpsinResult can be returned which can yield information as to why a name was not interpretable
Added support for unlocanted R/S/E/Z stereochemistry. Removed limit on number of atoms that stereochemistry code can handle
Added support for polymers e.g. poly(ethylene)
Improvements in handling of multiplicative nomenclature
Improvements to fusion nomenclature handling: multiplied components and multi parent systems are now supported
Improved support for functional class nomenclature; space detection has been improved and support has been added for anhydride,oxide,oxime,hydrazone,semicarbazone,thiosemicarbazone,selenosemicarbazone,tellurosemicarbazone,imide
Support for the lambda convention
Locanted esters
Improvements in dearomatisation code
CML output changed to being CML-Lite compliant
Speed improvements
Support for greek letters e.g. as alpha or $a or Î±
Added more infixes
Added more suffixes
Vocabulary improvements
Systematic handling of amino acid nomenclature
Added support for perhydro
Support for ylium/uide
Support for locants like N-1 (instead of N1)
Fixed potential infinite loop in fused ring numbering
Made grammar more lenient in many places e.g. euphonic o, optional sqaure brackets
Sulph is now treated like sulf as in sulphuric acid
and many misc fixes and improvements

Version 0.53
Added support for amic, aldehydic, anilic, anilide, carboxanilide and amoyl suffixes
Added support for cyclic imides e.g. succinimide/succinimido
Added support for amide functional class
Support for locants such as N5 which means a nitrogen that is attached in some way to position 5. Locants of this type may also be used in ester formation.
Some improvements to functional replacement using prefixes e.g. thioethanoic acid now works
Disabled stereochemistry in molecules with over 300 atoms as a temporary fix to the problem in 0.52
Slight improvement in method for deciding which group detachable hydro prefixes apply to.
Minor vocabulary update

Version 0.52
Outputting directly to InChI is now supported using the separately available nameToInchi jar (an OPSIN jar is expected in the same location as the nameToInchi jar)
Fused rings with any number of rings in a chain or formed entirely of 6 membered rings can now be numbered
Added support for E/Z/R/S where locants are given. Unlocanted cases will be dealt with in a subsequent release. In very large molecules a lack of memory may be encountered, this will be resolved in a subsequent release
Some Infixes are now supported e.g. ethanthioic acid
All spiro systems with Von Baeyer brackets are now supported e.g. dispiro[4.2.4.2]tetradecane
Vocabulary increase (especially: terpenes, ingorganic acids, fused ring components)
Fixed some problems with components with both acylic and cyclic sections e.g. trityl
Improved locant assignments e.g. 2-furyl is now also fur-2-yl
Speed improvements
Removed dependence on Nux/Saxon
Misc minor fixes

Version 0.51
Huge reduction in OPSIN initialisation time (typical ~7 seconds -->800ms)
Allowed thio/seleno/telluro as divalent linkers and for functional replacement when used as prefixes. Peroxy can now be used for functional replacement
Better support for semi-trivally named hydrocarbon fused rings e.g. tetracene
Better handling of carbonic acid derivatives
Improvements to locant assignment
Support for names like triethyltetramine and triethylene glycol
Misc other fixes to prevent OPSIN generating the wrong structure for certain types of names
